A simple Bash script that will setup the file-system needed for a
CSC337 (Web Development) project.

It is intended to be placed in a webdev/x folder, where webdev contains
all CSC337 projects, and x is an arbitrary name. In the future, it will be 
configurable so that this is not as rigid.

USAGE: bash setup.sh project_dir_name

project_dir_name is the desired name of the project directory







Better README formatting coming soon. This is my first nontrivial Bash script,
so please don't judge me too harshly for it just yet :)
